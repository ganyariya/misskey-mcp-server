# Project Structure Guide

This project is a Misskey MCP server implemented in Go.

## Main Directory Structure

- `cmd/misskey-mcp-server/`: Main entry point
- `internal/`: Internal packages
  - `misskey_tools/`: Internal packages for Misskey API tools (e.g., note, user). Each subdirectory typically represents a Misskey API category.
  - `tools/`: Core tool registration and interface definitions.
- `docs/images/`: Project image files

## Important Files

- [go.mod](mdc:go.mod): Dependency management
- [README.md](mdc:README.md): Project overview and usage

## Development Environment Setup

Before starting development, you need to set the following environment variables:

- `MISSKEY_API_TOKEN`: Misskey API token
- `MISSKEY_PROTOCOL`: Protocol (http/https)
- `MISSKEY_DOMAIN`: Misskey server domain
- `MISSKEY_PATH`: Path (optional)

However, as an AI, it is difficult for you to actually provide these environment variables.
Therefore, it is not always necessary to confirm whether the MCP server can communicate properly. Please check if possible, but if it is difficult, you do not need to do so.
Instead, please ask a human engineer to confirm that it works correctly.
