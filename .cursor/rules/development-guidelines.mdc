# Development Guidelines

## Coding Standards

1. Follow Go's standard coding conventions
2. Package names should be lowercase with underscores for word separation
3. Add appropriate documentation comments for exported identifiers (those starting with capital letters)

## Testing

- Implement appropriate tests for each package
- Test files should follow the `*_test.go` naming convention

## Pull Requests

1. Work on new features or bug fixes in a new branch
2. Write clear and specific commit messages
3. Include the changes and reasons in the pull request description

## Comments

- Keep comments to a minimum. In fact, try to write as few as possible.

## Required Actions After Implementation

After implementation, please update the .cursor/rules as needed.
Add context to make development easier.

Also, update README.md according to the implemented API endpoints.
